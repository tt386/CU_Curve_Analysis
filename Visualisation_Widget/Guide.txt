A simple widget for trying to find the co-moving reference frame speed for travelling wave solution to different models of cardiomyocyte excitation

The model employed can be toggled on the right with the radio box

The speed of the comoving reference frame can be changed with the slider labelled 'c'

The input voltage can be can be changed with the slider labelled 'I'


The activation parameter can be changed by the user with three buttons:
	- Reset: Sets u and v back to default
	- Wipe Outside: Sets everything to 0 outside of the reio=gion selected with the space selector
	- Perturb inside: Sets u to the value written in the 'Perturb' box


Save the model with 'Save the System' at the bottom 


The top right checkbox enables an algorithm to determine the c value which corresponds to the comoving reference frame being th same as the wave.
